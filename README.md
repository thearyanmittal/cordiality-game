# Cordiality Game Minimax Code
This code runs a minimax game tree search to determine the game cordiality number for a path of length `n`. Each file computes the game score for a specific variant of the game (Cordiality Game or Balance Game) and for a particular player (Impish or Admirable) having the first move.

A description of the game is available [here](https://thearyanmittal.github.io/research/cordiality_abstract.pdf).
